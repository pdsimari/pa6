# Programming Assignment 6

**Due:** Mon Dec 7, 10am

**Note** This assignment will include a separate **presentation** component. A Moodle entry will contain the presentation requirements and allow for its submission.

## Problem

The problem will be different for each team. Once your team has chosen a dataset, **problem-specific instructions will be pushed to your Github repository along with the data files**.

## Instructions

1. Create a new Python file and place **intro comments** using the template below. 
2. Use comments to **write the algorithm** your program will follow, **including functions**.
3. Write the Python **code** corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.

**Commit** and **push** changes and check your repository on github.com to confirm your updates before the deadline.

### Intro comments template

```
# Team Members: [your names]
# Course: CS151, Dr. Simari  
# Programming Assignment: 6
# Program Inputs: [What information do you request from the user?]
# Program Outputs: [What information do you display for the user?]
```

##Requirements for Presentation:

* Must use **PowerPoint slides** containing the following (in order):

	1. Title slide with name of project and presenters
	2. Description of chosen problem, dataset, and questions answered
	3. Discussion of each question asked about the data:
		* Show results obtained including graphs and interpret them. You may include other relevant graphics (e.g. map of Baltimore neighborhoods for Baltimore datasets).
		* If a question requires user input, choose an input value that gives interesting results to present.
	4. Brief statement of what you found easy, what you found difficult, and what you would do differently next time.

* **Each person should do similar amount of presenting**, including presenting results from their own calculation functions.

* Each group will be allotted **5 minutes** total.

**Grading**: You will be graded on how well you meet the above guidelines, including how well you communicate your results and stay within the allotted time.

**Practice your presentation**: work through multiple iterations to get the right length. Be clear and concise without leaving out important information.

## Submission

* GitHub: Completed .py file (including comments).
* Moodle: Your PowerPoint slides. 

This assignment does **not** require a flowchart or test cases.
